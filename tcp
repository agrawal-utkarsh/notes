flow control
error control
congestion control

as is likely; fucking overhead in tcp

send and receive window
send window->open,close,shrink
send window similar to sr window but byte numbering,sending as soon as received and only one timer(used in error control)


receive window->open,close
receiver window similar to sr window but ((rwnd = buffer size âˆ’ number of waiting bytes to be pulled)) and cumulative ack

FLOW COONTROL-----
  
To achieve flow control, TCP forces the sender and the receiver to adjust their window
sizes, although the size of the buffer for both parties is fixed when the connection is
established. The receive window closes (moves its left wall to the right) when more
bytes arrive from the sender; it opens (moves its right wal l to the right) when more
bytes are pulled by the process. We assume that it does not shrink (the right wall does
not move to the left).
The opening, closing, and shrinking of the send window is controlled by the
receiver. The send window closes (moves its left wall to the right) when a new
acknowledgement allows it to do so. The send window opens (its right wall moves to
the right) when the receive window size (rwnd) advertised by the receiver allows it to
do so. The send window shrinks on occasion. We assume that this situation does not
occur.

















ERROR CONTROL->
there is a solution for everything,

remedy are checksum,ack,timeout



retransmission->timer expiration or three duplicate acknowledgements


CONGESTION CONTROL->
